# Python-Crash-Course-Exercises
This repository hosts my exercises from Eric Matthes' Python Crash Course book. 

Note: these exercises follow the natural progression on the topics discussed in the book, starting from chapter 3. I know that there may be other functions and methods that may be used in earlier exercises; however, I have to do the daunting work of writing longer, repetitive codes to show how it functions. 

I am so looking forward to tracking my learning, skills and projects as I continue in my learning. 

Feel free to comment as see fit. 

Thank you,
